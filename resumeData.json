    "bio":"I'm a fourth-year student at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science with a Minor in Chemistry. My passion for Science and Math began at a young age and laid the groundwork for my Computer Science journey, which started my freshman year of college. Outside of my classes, I've served as a Teaching Assistant in various Computer Science and Chemistry classes at Stony Brook, and am a member of both the Stony Brook Marching Band and Investment Club. My interests include Coding, Algorithms/Algorithm Design, Data Analysis, and Financial Analysis. In my spare time, I like to code, read, play video games or play the guitar.
